## Setup
Before running the project, some environment variables have to be set. This is achieved by adding the (gitignored) ".env" files in the respective directories.
".env" files consist of key-value pairs that are loaded as environment variables to the app reading them as to not pollute the global scope. The format is simply line-separated `KEY=value` pairs.
More details about specific variables in the respective folder (where needed).

## Running

To run this project, simply run `docker-compose up` and then access [localhost](http://localhost) to see it running.
